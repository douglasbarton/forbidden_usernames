Disallowed Usernames
====================
<b>What?</b>

An open source database of dis-allowed usernames for startups.

The goal of this project is to create a universal database of disallowed usernames for web applications. 

<b>Format:</b> CSV

</b>Why?</b>

For example, you don't want someone to sign-up with the username titled 'support'.

And depending on your set-up, they could probably generate something like:

http://example.com/support

or

http://support.example.com

and use this to send out emails impersonating as someone un-suspecting from your Startup. Now, that's are dangerous! And hence, the purpose of this list.

<b>How?</b>

You can also import this file directly from your database's GUI (like phpmyadmin).
